**ALIGNMENT, CONSISTENCY & VISUAL HIERARCHY**
+ Presentations on the dashboard appear in a grid structure to promote to visual alignment 
+ One font face was used throughout the webpage to establish consistency. 
+ The size, boldness and colour of the text is changed to create visual hierarchy, e.g. bolded text for presentation titles with smaller grey text for their description. Headers of modals are purple to distinguish them from the body content.
+ The webpage employs a consistent colour scheme (shades of purple and light grey), with certain exceptions such as red for the “Delete Presentation” button and some coloured icons (e.g. background selection button icon) to help convey the icon’s purpose. 
+ The use of an analogous colour scheme also prevents a visual clash with the array of colours and styles that would be used in users’ presentations.
+ Less significant functionality, such as rearranging slides and adding transitions, are hidden behind a dropdown menu to reduce visual clutter on the page but also allowing easy navigation to access if needed.
+ Symmetry is prioritised in the design, e.g. upon previewing or editing a presentation, the slide and buttons are positioned in the centre of the page, as well as in edit mode, the components toolbar is also centred.

**AFFORDANCE & FAMILIARITY**
+ The background colour of clickable elements and the cursor icon changes on hover for affordance, indicating to users those elements can be interacted with.
+ The cursor icon also changes when users interact with elements that can be moved or resized.
+ On the login page, the ‘Don't have an account? Sign up here.’ text has ‘Sign up here’ bolded in purple to indicate to users it’s a clickable link.
+ All forms have bolded input fields on focus.
+ Buttons with important functions, such as Login, Register, Logout, Creating and deleting are labelled explicitly to tell the user how to interact with it.
+ Certain buttons, such as the dashboard’s ‘Create a presentation’ button, the ‘Preview’ button and ‘Back’ button on the edit page have accompanying symbols that match real world applications, such as the ‘+’ icon and ‘<-’ arrow
+ For certain buttons, such as adding a component, an icon that matches its purpose is used (e.g. T icon for text, image icon for adding an image) to reduce the amount of text on the screen, reducing visual clutter and improving the visual aesthetic of the page.
+ Elements with similar functionality are grouped together. E.g. buttons for adding components to a slide are grouped in a toolbar below the slide and the adding and deleting a slide buttons are grouped in a header above the slide, which helps establish the elements’ functionality.
+ Certain features are positioned in a standard layout, such as profile actions being on the top right, the back button in the top left, a header for the dashboard and edit presentation page, titles at the top of modals, to promote familiarity in the system.
+ Each component when not selected is given the pointer cursor to indicate that the component can be selected
+ When the user hovers over a component the border colour is changed to indicate that the user can interact with it and so they are aware of which element is currently in focus if they were to click
+ When the component is selected the cursor changes to a drag cursor when hovering over the box ensuring users are aware that they are ables to move the component
+ If the component is selected and the cursor is on one of the resizable corners, the cursor is changed to the relevant directional arrow so users can be sure they understand that the component can be resized
+ all of these cursor changes follow convention for what interactions a web element can have, allowing for more efficient use of the website as they are already aware of these functionalities.

**FEEDBACK & CONSTRAINTS**
+ Forms for login, registration and adding new components onto slides have required fields, and notifies the user through a pop up if they try to submit the form without filling the required fields in, providing helpful feedback on users’ errors and allowing them to easily recover from them. 
+ When a user makes an error, an error modal pops up with a description of the error to indicate to the user what they need to do to execute the action correctly. 
+ The rearranging slide functionality has a pop up once a user has changed the position of a slide to indicate that change was successful, offering feedback to establish clarity in this functionality.  

**EFFICIENCY & EFFECTIVENESS**
+ Frequently used features, such as adding components to a slide, previewing a presentation, adding and deleting slides are clearly displayed on the page, establishing effectiveness by allowing easy access for all important controls.
+ The process of creating a presentation, adding slides and adding new components to a slide have minimal steps to streamline the creation process. Many fields in the adding components modals are pre-filled in to reduce the amount of repetitive work the user has to do, allowing them to focus on modifying the fields they’d like to customise, improving the efficiency of the design.
+ Above each slide there is the current slide’s number and the total number of slides which serve as a ‘progress bar’ to offer the user transparency and more control over the system.
+ On the dashboard, each presentation has an icon with a number indicating the number of slides in that presentation.
+ For more complicated or unclear actions, such as applying transitions to a presentation, a small description explaining the scope of the feature is present below the header to promote learnability. 
+ To escape the delete component context menu users can simply left click anywhere on the screen and it will close the context menu, allowing for more efficient use of the application
